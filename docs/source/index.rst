Security software might block the connection, especially for networked or WiFi printers.

6. **Network or IP Address Issues**  
 
For wireless printers, being on a different network or dealing with IP address conflicts can disrupt communication.

7. **Corrupt Print Spooler Service**  
  
A stuck or corrupted print spooler can block all printing tasks between your computer and the printer.

8. **Printer Firmware Glitches**
