Why is My Canon Printer Offline on Windows or Mac?
--------------------------------------------------

Before attempting a fix, it’s essential to understand the possible reasons why your Canon printer goes offline. Below are some of the most common causes:

1. **Printer Connection Issues**  
   If your Canon printer is connected via USB, a loose or faulty cable could disrupt communication. In the case of WiFi or network printers, a weak or dropped connection can make your printer appear offline.

2. **Incorrect Printer Settings**  
   Your system might be set to print to a virtual printer or a different device. Alternatively, the printer may not be set as the default printer, causing offline errors.

3. **Outdated or Corrupt Printer Drivers**  
   Corrupted or outdated printer drivers can prevent your operating system from recognizing the printer correctly, leading to offline status.

4. **Print Spooler Service Issues**  
   The print spooler manages the print jobs sent to the printer. If this service freezes or encounters an error, your printer might go offline.

5. **Firmware or Software Glitches**  
   Firmware bugs or software conflicts on either the printer or computer can disrupt connectivity.

6. **Firewall or Antivirus Blocking Connection**  
   Sometimes, security software can block the printer connection, especially when using a network printer.
